# VitX

VitX is a nutrition and fitness tracker, built with Javascript, jQuery, MySQL, Sequelize and Google Authentication

Logging in with Google Authentication, users can add exercises from a local table, or food from the Edemam API.

jQuery is used to dynamically display user data, and to display their form before they submit it.
